# My Notion
A Planner application designed for student usage inspired by the application “Notion”

## Purpose:

This application is made for the purpose of assisting people who can't remember tasks, schedules, or events or keep messing it up.
Since most people when they get assigned a task they wwill just remember the task in their head. However in the end of the day, they eventually ended up forgetting about it.

Example Situation: 

Aj. Praphat assigned AI room to code 10 programs due on Sunday 0800 and Aj. Tanapoom assigned AI room to build a working car due on Friday 2000 and Aj. Nattaporn assigned Ai room to code a program to simulated projectile motion with air resistance accounted.
At this point everyone probably lost track of work and end up getting past due assignments.

## Benefits:

All of your task will be oriented and you will have less chances of missing out works. You will have better time management thus you can find time to go hangouts with your friends more easily.

## Features:

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) coded in Python using Tkinter module. The program featured a task and event memo. 
Both task and event memo are able to add details such as: Notes, Dates, Priority, Associates, Subject, and Current Progress. All data are display in a tree view panel. 
While working 
The program can also save the data that each individual had keyed in by using the JSON and OS module.
